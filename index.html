    <h5 class="card-title">VenuGopalaSwami Betta</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Venugopalaswamy Betta is a beautiful hilltop temple located near Krishna Raja Sagar (KRS) in Mysuru district, Karnataka. The temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna in the form of Venugopala (Krishna playing the flute). It was originally built in the 12th century during the Hoysala period and was later relocated and restored because the old temple site was submerged due to the KRS dam.

The temple stands on a small hill (betta) surrounded by the scenic backwaters of KRS, offering a peaceful and breathtaking view, especially during sunrise and sunset. The architecture reflects traditional Hoysala style with detailed carvings and stone structures. Today, Venugopalaswamy Betta is a popular tourist spot for photography, sightseeing, and spiritual visits. Its calm environment and natural beauty make it one of the hidden gems near Mysuru.</p>
